You will need to download all files from this drive into the same local file on your computer for it to run.

The formatting of the excel file may mess up a little while rerunning calculations so make sure to check them before copying them over to any reports.



Line 6: shows most recent update in relation to openrocket designs. Please update as you use.

Lines 29-98: These lines contain the only variables you will need to change to update the calculator to a new rocket version. Each line has a comment to the left for ease of use. All variables will be found throughout the openrocket file. For the Cd, please look up in openrocket Tools>Component Analysis>Drag Characteristics, and use the total drag for the THIRD ELEMENT of the Cd matrix, then adjust the other elements appropriately. Also the separate simulation data inputs should be separate simulations through openrocket, don't cut this corner even if it seems trivial.
