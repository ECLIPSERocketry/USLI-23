The Vehicle team is responsible for designing and manufacturing two rockets per competition. 
The design process is centered around the payload it will carry as well as NASAâ€™s requirements. 
We do hand calculations and use software to verify our design before flight. 
Some of the software you will get experienced with on the Vehicle team are OpenRocket, SolidWorks, MATLAB, and ANSYS. 
Beyond the design process there is the hands-on experience during the manufacturing cycle. 
This will provide members with the chance to use drills, taps, files, epoxies, and more. 
We provide a good mixture of both design and manufacturing to help create better engineers for the future.
